1. challenge of uneven sampling distribution:

We encounter the problem, that our alternative routes consist of two to three times less data points as our original routes. The denser sampling intervals in our original routes could lead to uneven calculations. For example, smaller intervals could detect more differences in height/slope than the wider sampling interval in the alternative routing


Because of the uneven distribution, we decided to interpolate along the original and alternative trajectories
Discuss a bit about this challenge and what it implies regarding scale


  
2. Alternatives with hereR. Limitations
We would have a lot of data but can not properly use them because the application of the package is limited

hereR 

Alles was in index ist, ins preprocessing.R

danach als objekt ins index laden, welches 


Wir sollten alle

df als csv abspeichern und danach in index einlesen
