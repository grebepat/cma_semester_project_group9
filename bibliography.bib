	abstract = {Recognizing the environmental and health benefits of cycling, cities around the world are promoting use of the bicycle for everyday transportation, but with limited information about the preferences of cyclists and the effectiveness of investments in bicycle infrastructure. To better understand the decision-making of cyclists, we estimated a route choice model with {GPS} data collected from smartphone users in San Francisco. Traces were automatically filtered for activities and mode transfers, and matched to a network model. Alternatives were extracted using repeated shortest path searches in which both link attributes and generalized cost coefficients were randomized. The prior distribution for the coefficients was calibrated automatically using only the network. A Path Size Multinomial Logit model revealed that bicycle lanes were preferred to other facility types, especially by infrequent cyclists. Steep slopes were disfavored, especially by women and during commutes. Other negative attributes included length and turns. Traffic volume, traffic speed, number of lanes, crime rates, and nightfall had no effect. Marginal rates of substitution imply a user benefit of bike lanes of \$0.61 {USD} per km per trip. Coefficients were applied to a trip assignment model that will be used to evaluate prospective investments in bicycle infrastructure in San Francisco.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates cyclist route choices using global positioning system ({GPS}) data collected from 750 bicycles in Hamilton, Ontario's bike share system – {SoBi} (Social Bicycles) Hamilton. A dataset containing 161,426 {GPS} trajectories describing observed routes of cyclists using {SoBi} bikes over a 12-month period (April 1, 2015 to March 31, 2016) is used for analysis. This study groups trips by origin-destination hub pairs and uses a {GIS} (geographic information system)-based map-matching algorithm to generate routes along with attributes such as length, number of intersections, number of turns, and unique road segments. Unique routes and their use frequencies are extracted from all the hub-to-hub trips using a {GIS}-based link signature extraction tool developed for this research. The most popular routes between hubs taken by cyclists are then identiﬁed as dominant routes and their attributes are compared to those of corresponding shortest path routes derived by minimizing distance traveled. The comparison ﬁnds signiﬁcant diﬀerences in multiple attributes, and demonstrates that dominant routes are signiﬁcantly longer than their shortest distance counterparts, suggesting that cyclists are willing to detour for routes characterized by positive features such as bicycle facilities and low traﬃc volumes. Detouring does, however, come at a cost – increases in number of turns and number of intersections. This research not only enhances our understanding of cyclist route preferences within a bike share system, it also presents a {GIS}-based approach for identifying potential locations for future bike facilities based on such preferences.},

	abstract = {It is the objective of the study to determine the extent to which human navigation is affected by perceptions of our immediate surroundings or by already established knowledge in terms of a cognitive map. The motivation is to contribute to the knowledge about human navigation and to inform planning with estimates of bicyclists’ route preferences and ‘willingness-to-pay’ (in terms of transport distance vs utility/disutility of route characteristics). The core method is choice modelling of observed route data. 1,267 trips performed by 183 cyclists in Copenhagen (Denmark) were recorded by {GPS}. The trips were map-matched to a digital road and path network, which enabled the generation of choice sets: one for navigation as influenced by perception of immediate surroundings, comprising edges connected to network-nodes (hereafter called the edge dataset), and one for navigation based on a priori knowledge, comprising the trip itself and a number of alternative routes generated by a labelling algorithm (hereafter called the route dataset). The results document that choices based on characteristics of both the route and the edge data can be estimated and provide reasonable and significant parameter estimates regarding cyclists’ preferences. Length was significant and negative, illustrating that cyclists –everything else kept equal – prefer to bike shorter distances. Preferences regarding characteristics of bike path, presence of traffic lights and road types show similar results to the two types of data; most importantly that routes with facilities, such as curbed tracks and segregated bikeways, were significantly preferred. The study concludes that cyclists’ wayfinding can be modelled as choices based on both an edge dataset and a route dataset and, thus, may be influenced by both perceived information and a priori knowledge. We suggest that future analyses of movement and route preferences take both modes into account as actual movement may be based on a combination of the two and because assessment of the influence of the immediate, perceivable surroundings can provide information not to be considered in a wayfinding approach. In our case differences in preferences along the route is for example found, but this can be expanded in future studies to also include dynamic aspects such as weather and crowding.},

            Data representing the trajectories of moving point objects are becoming increasingly ubiquitous in {GIScience}, and are the focus of much methodological research aimed at extracting patterns and meaning describing the underlying phenomena. However, current research within {GIScience} in this area has largely ignored issues related to scale and granularity – in other words how much are the patterns that we see a function of the size of the looking glass that we apply? In this article we investigate the implications of varying the temporal scale at which three movement parameters, speed, sinuosity and turning angle are derived, and explore the relationship between this temporal scale and uncertainty in the individual data points making up a trajectory. A very rich dataset, representing the movement of 10 cows over some two days every 0.25 s is investigated. Our cross‐scale analysis shows firstly, that movement parameters for all 10 cows are broadly similar over a range of scales when the data are segmented to remove quasi‐static subtrajectories. However, by exploring realistic values of {GPS} uncertainty using Monte Carlo Simulation, it becomes apparent that fine scale measurement of all movement parameters is masked by uncertainties, and that we can only make meaningful statements about movement when we take these uncertainties into account.},

Bicycle route preferences are analysed using a dataset from a {GPS}-assisted household travel survey conducted in the Tel Aviv metropolitan area. Different choice set generation methods were applied to generate alternative routes for each observation, and the matching with the actual route is discussed. Model estimation is performed for different route choice sets to test the sensitivity of the parameter estimates. The results obtained are quite consistent, and indicate an expected tendency to ride in longer routes, but with separated bike lanes. In the absence of such lanes, riders prefer to use local streets and avoid riding on busy arterial streets and highways.},
